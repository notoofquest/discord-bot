# A simple Discord Bot.
Here is just a simple discord bot I made. So simple!

Also, this code is gonna be compatible to repl.it, so you can use uptimerobot to ping the bot's website every 5 minutes, so you don't have to leave your repl.it page on for 24 hours a day!

Also if your feeling a bit lazy, go to https://replit.com/@oofquest/simple-discord-bot and fork my repl.

I don't know if I will ever complete this bot, maybe when summer comes. If you think I should finish this bot, then contact me. Thanks!

(Also forgot to mention: This Discord Bot is made for begginners so that you get a head start on making your own discord bot.)
